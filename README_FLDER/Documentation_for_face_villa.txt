General Overview of the Transfer Learning Model using MobileNetV2

1. Introduction
This project involves the use of Transfer Learning for image classification using MobileNetV2 as a pre-trained model. The dataset is structured into three directories:

train: Contains the training images.
val: Contains the validation images.
test: Contains the testing images.

The goal is to classify images into different categories using MobileNetV2 and fine-tuning the model to improve accuracy.

2. Dataset Structure
The images are divided into three sets:

Train Data: Used to train the model.
Validation Data: Used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
Test Data: Used to evaluate the final performance of the model.
The data is loaded using TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator for preprocessing and real-time data augmentation.

3. Model Architecture
This project utilizes MobileNetV2, a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN), pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The model is loaded without the top layers (classification layers) and is modified to suit the specific problem.

Base Model:

The MobileNetV2 model is loaded without the top classification layers (include_top=False), and its weights are initialized using the ImageNet dataset.
The input shape for the images is (100, 100, 3) which is 100x100 pixels and 3 channels (RGB).
Initially, the base model is frozen to avoid altering the pre-trained weights.
Custom Layers:

A GlobalAveragePooling2D layer is added to reduce the feature map to a single vector for each feature.
A Dense layer with 128 units and ReLU activation is added to introduce non-linearity.
The output layer is a Dense layer with the number of units equal to the number of classes in the dataset, using a softmax activation function for multi-class classification.

4. Model Compilation
The model is compiled using:

Optimizer: Adam optimizer is used for efficient gradient-based optimization.
Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy is used as this is a multi-class classification problem.
Metrics: Accuracy is used as the metric to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

5. Early Stopping
An EarlyStopping callback is applied to monitor the validation loss. If the validation loss does not improve for 3 consecutive epochs, training is stopped early to prevent overfitting. The best model weights are restored once early stopping is triggered.

6. Training Process
Two phases of training are performed:

Initial Training:
In the first phase, the MobileNetV2 base model is frozen, and only the newly added layers are trained for 20 epochs.
This is done to train the new layers without modifying the pre-trained layers.
Fine-Tuning:
In the second phase, the last 50 layers of the base MobileNetV2 model are unfrozen, allowing for fine-tuning.
The learning rate is reduced to 1e-5 to prevent drastic updates to the weights of the unfrozen layers.
The model is further trained for 10 epochs to fine-tune the weights of the pre-trained layers while maintaining the stability of the learned features.

7. Evaluation
The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to assess its generalization ability. The model's test accuracy is printed after evaluation.

python code
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(test_data)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {test_accuracy}')

8. Model Saving
After fine-tuning, the trained model is saved in the .keras format for future use. This allows for reloading and continuing training or using the model for predictions without retraining.

python code
model.save('face_40_transfer_learning.keras')

9. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of Transfer Learning by using MobileNetV2 to achieve high accuracy in image classification. By leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning, we are able to achieve better performance with fewer training data and computational resources.
